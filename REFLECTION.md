1. Can I explain what my code does?
My code builds a responsive resume website with sections for "About Me," "Skills," and "Contact." It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and media queries for responsiveness. Custom Google Fonts and accessibility features like ARIA roles enhance the user experience.

2. What was my coding process?
I planned the structure, then created a semantic HTML layout. I applied Flexbox and CSS Grid for positioning, added Google Fonts, and implemented media queries for responsiveness. I worked in Git branches for each feature and merged once complete.

3. What challenges did I have?
I struggled with responsive design, especially ensuring the layout worked on smaller screens. I also had to adjust color contrast to meet accessibility standards.

4. What would I do differently now?
I would start by testing on mobile-first to ensure better responsiveness from the beginning and would integrate accessibility checks earlier in the process.
